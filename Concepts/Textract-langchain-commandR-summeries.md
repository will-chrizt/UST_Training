# AWS Textract

## Core Function
AWS Textract is a machine learning service designed to automatically extract text, handwriting, and structured data from documents, including images and PDFs.

## Beyond OCR
Textract surpasses traditional Optical Character Recognition (OCR) by not only recognizing characters but also understanding the document's structure, such as forms and tables, for intelligent data extraction.

## How It Works
- Utilizes deep learning to:
  - Detect text within documents.
  - Analyze the layout and structure.
  - Extract data based on the document's context and organization.

## Key Data Extraction Capabilities
1. **Printed Text and Handwriting**:
   - Recognizes and converts both printed text and handwriting into machine-readable text.
2. **Forms**:
   - Identifies and extracts data as key-value pairs (e.g., "Name:" and its corresponding value).
3. **Tables**:
   - Preserves the row and column structure of tables during data extraction.
4. **Signatures**:
   - Detects the presence of signatures within a document.

## Specialized APIs
Textract provides pre-trained models tailored for specific document types:
- **AnalyzeExpense**: Extracts data from invoices and receipts.
- **AnalyzeID**: Processes identity documents, such as passports and driver's licenses.
- **Query-Based Extraction**: Allows users to specify data to extract using natural language questions.

## Processing Modes
- **Synchronous**: Ideal for real-time processing of single-page or small documents.
- **Asynchronous**: Suitable for large, multi-page documents requiring batch processing.

## Common Use Cases
Textract is widely adopted across various industries to automate data entry and streamline workflows:
- **Finance**: Processing loan applications.
- **Healthcare**: Extracting data from medical records.
- **Public Sector**: Handling forms and applications.
- **Retail**: Managing invoices and receipts.

## Integration
- Seamlessly integrates with other AWS services:
  - **Amazon S3**: For document storage.
  - **AWS Lambda**: For automated processing and workflows.
