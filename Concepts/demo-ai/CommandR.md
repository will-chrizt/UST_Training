### Implementation in an Application
Implementing Command R requires access to the Cohere API, typically via Python. Setup involves obtaining an API key from Cohere and installing the SDK. Examples below assume a Python environment and focus on the Chat endpoint for conversational tasks. All examples use the latest model version (`command-r-plus-08-2024` for Command R+).

#### Simple LLM Application: Text Translation
This example illustrates a basic multilingual translation task using prompt engineering.

1. **Setup and Installation**:
   - Install the Cohere SDK: `pip install cohere`.
   - Initialize the client with your API key:
     ```python
     import cohere
     import os
     co = cohere.Client(api_key=os.getenv("COHERE_API_KEY"))
     ```

2. **Generate Response**:
   ```python
   response = co.chat(
       model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
       message="Translate the following English text to Italian: 'Hello, how are you?'",
       temperature=0.1  # Low temperature for consistent output
   )
   print(response.text)  # Output: "Ciao, come stai?"
   ```

3. **Add Reproducibility**:
   - Include a seed for deterministic results:
     ```python
     response = co.chat(
         model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
         message="Who is the author of 'Matilda'?",
         seed=55  # Ensures reproducible output: "Roald Dahl"
     )
     ```

**Best Practices**: Use low temperature (0.1–0.3) for factual tasks. Leverage the model's multilingual training by specifying the target language in the prompt. Monitor token usage to stay within the 128,000 context limit.

#### Advanced Example: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App
RAG with Command R enhances responses by grounding them in retrieved documents, ideal for knowledge-intensive queries.

1. **Indexing**:
   - Use Cohere Embed to vectorize documents and store in a vector database (e.g., FAISS or Pinecone).

2. **Retrieval and Generation**:
   - Retrieve relevant snippets and pass to the Chat endpoint with documents parameter:
     ```python
     documents = [
         {"text": "Document snippet 1 about topic X."},
         {"text": "Document snippet 2 with relevant facts."}
     ]
     response = co.chat(
         model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
         message="What is the capital of France?",
         documents=documents,
         temperature=0.0
     )
     print(response.text)  # Grounded response with citations
     ```

3. **Enhance with Rerank**:
   - Integrate Rerank for better relevance:
     ```python
     rerank_results = co.rerank(
         query="Capital of France",
         documents=["Paris is the capital...", "London is in England..."],
         top_n=1
     )
     # Use top result in RAG prompt
     ```

**Best Practices**: Provide few-shot examples in the system prompt for complex RAG. Use citations from the response to trace sources. Optimize for long contexts by chunking large documents.

#### Advanced Example: Building an Agent with Tool Use
Agents leverage Command R's tool-calling for dynamic workflows, such as integrating external APIs.

1. **Setup**:
   - Define tools in JSON schema format.

2. **Define Tools and Invoke**:
   ```python
   tools = [
       {
           "name": "get_weather",
           "description": "Get current weather for a city",
           "parameter_definitions": [
               {"name": "city", "type": "STRING", "description": "City name", "required": True}
           ]
       }
   ]
   response = co.chat(
       model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
       message="What's the weather in Paris?",
       tools=tools
   )
   # Response includes tool calls if needed, e.g., {"name": "get_weather", "parameters": {"city": "Paris"}}
   ```

3. **Execute Tool and Continue**:
   - Parse tool calls, execute, and feed results back:
     ```python
     tool_results = [{"tool_use_id": response.tool_calls[0].id, "output": {"status": 200, "data": "Sunny, 22°C"}}]
     final_response = co.chat(
         model="command-r-plus-08-2024",
         message=response.message,  # Previous message
         tools=tools,
         tool_results=tool_results
     )
     print(final_response.text)  # "The weather in Paris is sunny with 22°C."
     ```

**Best Practices**: Validate tool outputs before feeding back. Use safety modes to filter inappropriate tool calls. Test multi-turn conversations to ensure context retention.
