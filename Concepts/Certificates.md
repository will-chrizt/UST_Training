Certificates in Kubernetes
In Kubernetes, certificates are critical for securing communication between components (e.g., API server, kubelet, etcd) and validating their identities during API requests, including worker node registration and status updates. Kubernetes uses certificates to ensure that only trusted entities can interact with the cluster, which ties directly into API validation and worker node validation.
Key Roles of Certificates in Kubernetes

Authentication:

Certificates identify components or users to the API server. For example, the kubelet on a worker node uses a certificate to prove its identity when registering or updating its Node object.
The API server verifies the certificate to ensure the request comes from a legitimate source.


Secure Communication:

All communication between Kubernetes components (e.g., kubelet to API server, controller manager to API server) uses TLS to encrypt data.
Certificates enable TLS by providing the public/private key pair needed for secure connections.


Authorization:

Certificates often include metadata (e.g., the subject’s name or group) used in Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to determine what actions the entity can perform.
For example, a kubelet’s certificate might include its node name, which RBAC policies use to grant permissions for updating its Node object.
